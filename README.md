# Constellations
Graphic construction based in a dataset of stars and constellations

## 3D - Graphic

Using Cartesian plane coordinates in three dimensions, the stars are drawn and different constellations are traced. This is the simulation of a drop of the universe.

## 2D - Graphic

Using Cartesian plane coordinates in two dimensions, the stars are drawn and different constellations are traced. This is the simulation of a drop of the universe.

## Brightness

All stars have different brightnesses, which are defined randomly.
